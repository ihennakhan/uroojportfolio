<br>
<br>
            Design process: I designed the packaging in such a way that it gives it a sleek and professional appearance. I covered the majority of the design area with colour of paint it would store inside it as it would make it easier for customers to get the right colour paint.</p>
            <h1>Product Design</h1>
            <img class="logo2" src="product.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Project description: Hello we want you to  design a food packaging label for a Chicken Khadi Masala that should be both informative and elegant to look at. We want the design to be consistent with our company's branding, and to accurately reflect the taste and quality of the product.
       <br> 
       <br>
                Design process: For the design I used the colour blue because it is associated with trust and cleanliness. It is also a color that is not commonly found in food packaging, so it can help products stand out on the shelf. I put a large picture of a chicken khadi in the middle as it would make it more easier for the customer to find the product.</p>
